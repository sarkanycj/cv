        <p><em>Learning and Development Professional</em></p>
      <p>As a passionate learning and development professional, I strive to be a catalyst for positive change in the lives of those I work with and for. I enjoy the arts of writing and training. Happily combining both to career marketing, resume writing & critiquing, technical writing, live and recorded training. My attention to detail, time management practices, and ability to objectively edit have allowed me to be successful in both career development and eLearning environments. By combining best practices for case management, editing and needs assessment I can effectively create and monitor content for a variety of audiences, having specialized in both youth and adult learning at different points along my career. Case (and project) management should go beyond reporting requirements and extend into developing a strong rapport with clients to provide them the best service possible. I am not afraid to say no but love to have the data for why a "yes" is the appropriate response or bridging the gap by asking the questions to help influence the yes outcome. </p>
